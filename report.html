If possible, you should also test your pages on Internet Explorer, e.g. using IE itself, or the IE Tab add-on for Firefox, or a web site like browsershots.com or netrenderer.com. If not, then I expect you to make some statement in your report for the assignment to say what approach you have taken to old IEs.

For the most part, you can test images on just one browser. The main exception is using transparency. In that case, you should either find out how to patch up your pages so that old IEs do support the transparency, or prove in your report that you understand the issue and make sure your site degrades gracefully.
